## Running the node

### Dependencies

* Latest releases of Node and npm.
* Bitcoin Core.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your computer, either through the Github site or using the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/rolled-bit/rolled-bit.git
```

In the downloaded folder, install all the needed NPM packages:

```
npm install 
```

For Bitcoin Core, you can simply to into their website: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/ and download the latest release. Note that Windows users might have to configure PATH to have all the tools available to use on command-line.

### Setting up your Bitcoin node

It is recommended to test Rolled Bit with a regtest Bitcoin node. After you have installed Bitcoin Core, open your terminal and type:

```sh
# 18332 is the standard port for regtest, change the username, password and fallback fee if you want
bitcoind -chain=regtest -rpcport=18332 -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpass -fallbackfee=0.000001
```

In another console, type:

```sh
# Create a wallet
bitcoin-cli -regtest createwallet "mywallet"
# Generate 101 blocks, this is to give your wallet coins to start
bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate 101
```

### Configuration

In the directory downloaded, we will see a file called `config.js`, that's where we will configure our Rolled Bit client.

Originally, it will come with something like this:

```js
export default {
    // Your Bitcoin's private key
    BTC_RPC_USERNAME: "Your Bitcoin RPC username",
    BTC_RPC_PASSWORD: "Your Bitcoin RPC password",
    BTC_RPC_URL: "Your bitcoin RPC url"

    // Your Rolled Bit private key (similar to Ethereum's private key)
    // This key is only used for testing!!! DON'T USE IT FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES!
    // We recommend using this key for testing because currently all tokens are minted to this account
    PRIVKEY: "0x3f1c78a7c6c46e3d8a45b1bc29048719bff0903375cd066ccb7675ce4c77752e",
    
    // Enable sequencer or not, leave false if you don't want to
    SEQUENCER_MODE: true,
    // Address to be paid in (gas fees from transactions you sequenced will bet transferred to this address)
    // This is also the address generated from the private key above
    SEQUENCER_ADDRESS: "0xa39372a91baa8dcad7ee9da3d8311cf249dded06",

    // Contract address for batch upload, don't change this one
    ROLLUP_ADDRESS: "bcrt1q87tahummznh53dl2qcezxgy9fj53gt2lzfpffa",
    
    // Original Bitcoin block height to start syncing from, this also should not be changed
    // Although, as mentioned in the tutorial, you can change it as a way to reset the chain
    START_SYNC: 120,

    // RPC server config, you can set it to whatever you like, but you should just leave it 3000 cause our tests use it.
    RPC_PORT: 3000,

    // Directories to store our databases in, here's an example on our computer.
    // THESE ARE MUST-HAVEs AND THE USER MUST PROVIDE THEIR OWN PATH TO HAVE THE DATABASE STORED
    // The main Rolled Bit database that includes state data, contract storage, etc.
    LEVEL_PATH: "C:/Users/npqua/desktop/rolled-bit/leveldb",
    // A log file that contains the current synced Bitcoin block and current address index
    LOG_FILE: "C:/Users/npqua/desktop/rolled-bit/log",
    // Address index DB used for compression
    ADDRESS_DB_PATH: "C:/Users/npqua/desktop/rolled-bit/addressdb",
    INDEX_DB_PATH: "C:/Users/npqua/desktop/rolled-bit/indexdb",

    // Genesis details
    // The first account to have the Rolled Bit tokens minted to
    // This is also the address generated from the private key above
    FIRST_MINT_ADDR: "0xa39372a91baa8dcad7ee9da3d8311cf249dded06",
    // First minted tokens (must not exceed 11 bytes)
    FIRST_MINT_AMOUNT: "100000000000000000000000000",

    // Choose whether to export the private key or not, should be false unless you are doing something really special and dangerous.
    EXPORT_PRIVKEY: false
}
```

### Running 

After having all the configurations done, simply type into your console:

```
node .
```

to start up the client.

### JSON-RPC APIs

For dapps and tools to interact with the Rolled Bit client, the client exposes JSON-RPC APIs for dapps to call locally.

[Here is the documentation on the RPC methods.](./RPC.md)

### Testing

To test it out yourself, go to [`try-it-out.md`](./try-it-out.md);

### Reset the chain

If you want to reset the chain, you can change the START_SYNC configuration to the current Bitcoin block height (if you are running regtest, use your own chain's block height), delete the old database folders and re-run the node. What this does it that it will start off with an entirely new state, ignoring all transactions done in the past, therefore making an entirely new chain.

This is alos mentioned again in `try-it-out.md`.
